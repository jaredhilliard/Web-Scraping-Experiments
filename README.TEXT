This is a collection of Web Scraping projects.

1)My First Webscraping (The President's Lies) - based on the following tutorial http://www.dataschool.io/python-web-scraping-of-president-trumps-lies/
2)Conference Scraping Experiment - I saw an upwork post asking if someone could scrape conference data to build a continuously updating list and was curious if I could do that.
